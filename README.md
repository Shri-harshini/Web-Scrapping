## Web Scraping
Web Scraping is a Python-based automation project designed to extract, process, and organize data from websites in an efficient and reliable manner. By utilizing libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, the project parses HTML content, retrieves relevant information, and converts unstructured web data into structured formats suitable for analysis and storage. It supports automated data cleaning, validation, and transformation, enabling accurate and consistent datasets for downstream use. The project is highly useful for real-world applications such as price tracking, news and article aggregation, market research, and competitive analysis, significantly reducing manual data collection efforts. With a scalable design, the system can be extended to include features like scheduled scraping, database and cloud integration, advanced error handling, proxy and user-agent rotation, API exposure, and data visualization dashboards. This makes the project a strong foundation for building intelligent, production-ready data collection pipelines.
